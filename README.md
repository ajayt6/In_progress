# In_progress

##Observations:
1)Randomly getting all pass vs some failures sepcifically at test 26 for the timeout based entry removal implementaion. Majority of the time this is happening when output is redirected to a file instead of standard output.

##Tasks
1)Implemented all three cases separately
2)Ran and passed all given test cases
3)Ran implemeented switches in Mininet (interesting observations)
4)ToDO: Finish custom test cases
